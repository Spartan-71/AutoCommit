## Features

- **Local AI-Powered**: Generates commit messages using a small LLM models locally
- **Flexible Editing**: Review and edit generated messages before committing
- **Git Integration**: Seamlessly works with your existing Git workflow
- **Resource-Efficient**: Minimal computational overhead with lightweight LLM models
- **Multiple Language Model Support**: Option to choose different local AI models


### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10** or higher
- **Git** installed and configured
- **RAM**:  
   - 8GB for smaller models (3B)  
   - 16GB for optimal performance
- **GPU** (Optional): Boosts performance, but not required
  
### Installation

> It is recommended to use virtual environment.
 
```bash
pip install autocommitt
```
OR
```bash
uv pip install autocommitt
```
### Upgrading
> If u already have autocommitt installed, then make sure to upgrade to latest version.

```bash
pip install -U autocommitt
```

### Usage

1. Start the Ollama server:
   ```bash
   autocommitt start
   ```

2. Generate and edit commit message:
   ```bash
   autocommitt gen
   ```
   This will generate a commit message based on your changes using the Llama 3.2:3B model (default). Edit it if needed.

3. Press Enter to commit your changes.

   **Note:** When you're done generating commit messages, be sure to stop the Ollama server by running:
   ```bash
   autocommitt stop
   ```

That's it! :)

## Roadmap

- **Interactive Mode**: Enhanced CLI interface for improved user experience
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Enhanced compatibility for Windows and macOS.
- **Custom Templates**: Support for user-defined commit message templates
- **Git Hooks Integration**: Compatible with pre-commit hooks

## Project Status

- [x] Basic commit message generation
- [x] Local AI model integration
- [x] Python package release
- [x] Multi-model support
- [ ] Interactive mode
- [ ] Cross-platform testing
- [ ] Custom template support

## How It Works
It runs the `git diff --staged` command to gather all staged changes and processes them using a local LLM (default: `llama3.2:3b` provided by Ollama). The model analyzes the changes and generates a concise, context-aware commit message, ensuring privacy and avoiding external API dependencies.
