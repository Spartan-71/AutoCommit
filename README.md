- **Multiple Language Model Support**: Option to choose different local AI models

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git installed and configured
- Minimum 8GB RAM recommended

### Installation

```bash
pip install autocommitt
```

### Usage

1. Start the Ollama server:
   ```bash
